# Welcome to `thingstodo`!

This is an early version of a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) note-taking and project management project designed for professional tasks, everyday activities and group planning. It was created using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
